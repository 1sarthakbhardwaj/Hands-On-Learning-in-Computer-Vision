Here's a detailed analysis of the YouTube video tracking data provided:

**1. Overall Performance Summary**

*   **Ed Sheeran - Sapphire (Official Music Video) is performing significantly better in terms of initial growth compared to Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Video) (4K Remaster) during the tracked period.** This is primarily evident in the hourly view growth (27178.8 vs. 12320.28).
*   **However, it's crucial to acknowledge that the Rick Astley video has a vastly larger overall audience and longer lifespan.** Comparing initial growth to videos with billions of views isn't entirely fair.

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Comparison (Growth - tracked time = ~22 hours):**

    *   **Views:** Ed Sheeran significantly outpaces Rick Astley in hourly view growth.
    *   **Likes:** Ed Sheeran's like growth per hour is also higher than Rick Astley's.
    *   **Comments:** Ed Sheeran's comment growth is positive, while Rick Astley's shows a *decrease* in comments. This is a significant point of difference.

**2. Growth Rate Analysis**

*   **View Growth Patterns and Rates:**
    *   **Ed Sheeran:** View growth of approximately 27,179 views per hour. The video is likely benefitting from release hype, algorithmic pushes, and inherent audience appeal of Ed Sheeran's new music.
    *   **Rick Astley:** View growth of approximately 12,320 views per hour. Despite its age, this video maintains a solid view rate, driven by nostalgia, its iconic status, and its use in "Rickrolling."

*   **Engagement Growth (Likes and Comments):**
    *   **Ed Sheeran:** 148.1 likes per hour and 1.06 comments per hour.
    *   **Rick Astley:** 70.81 likes per hour and -22.25 comments per hour. The negative comment growth is unusual and warrants further investigation (possible spam removal, comment moderation, or recent negative sentiment).

*   **Growth Velocity Trends:**
    *   **Ed Sheeran:** The initial growth is strong. It is critical to see if this momentum is maintained over the next few days/weeks. Early success doesn't guarantee long-term performance. The initial velocity is high, but will it sustain itself?
    *   **Rick Astley:**  The view growth is consistent for such an old video. Its growth is not a spike but more of a steady stream. The negative comment growth might indicate the need for community management or a review of recent comments to understand the cause.

**3. Engagement Quality Assessment**

*   **Like-to-View Ratios:**
    *   **Ed Sheeran:** 3,860,708 Likes / 177,886,639 Views = 0.0217 (2.17%)
    *   **Rick Astley:** 18,543,172 Likes / 1,692,944,030 Views = 0.0109 (1.09%)
    *   **Insight:** Ed Sheeran's video has a significantly higher like-to-view ratio, indicating potentially stronger audience appreciation or engagement with the content compared to Rick Astley's video. This could reflect differing audience demographics or the recency effect.

*   **Comment-to-View Ratios:**
    *   **Ed Sheeran:** 140,508 Comments / 177,886,639 Views = 0.00079 (0.079%)
    *   **Rick Astley:** 2,403,870 Comments / 1,692,944,030 Views = 0.00142 (0.142%)
    *   **Insight:** Despite losing comments, Rick Astley's video has a higher overall comment-to-view ratio. This suggests that, historically, "Never Gonna Give You Up" has sparked more discussion and engagement than Ed Sheeran's video (even when accounting for the recent negative trend).

*   **Overall Audience Engagement Quality:**  Ed Sheeran is getting high initial engagement. Rick Astley maintains steady views with a decent comment to view ratio, though the comment growth is negative, indicating a decline in engagement in the *tracked* period. Ed Sheeran may have better initial engagement due to recency and fan base excitement of the new release.

**4. Content Performance Insights**

*   **Factors Contributing to Performance Differences:**

    *   **Content Type & Appeal:** Both are music videos. Rick Astley's video has unique cultural significance due to the "Rickrolling" phenomenon.
    *   **Algorithm and Platform Trends:** YouTube's algorithm favors newer content. Also, the algorithm may have shifted to emphasize newer, "relevant" comments, leading to spam removal or negative comment trends.
