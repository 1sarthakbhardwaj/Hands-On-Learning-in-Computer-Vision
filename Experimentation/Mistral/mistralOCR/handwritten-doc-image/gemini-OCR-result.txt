**Chapter 1: Modules, Comments & pip**

Lets write our very first python program.
Create a file called hello.py and paste the below code in it

print ("Hello World") → print is a function (More later)

Execute this file (py file) by typing python hello.py and you will see Hello World printed on the screen.

**Modules**
A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) which can be imported and used in our programs.

**Pip**
Pip is the package manager for python
You can use pip to install a module on your system
→ pip install flask installs flask module.
